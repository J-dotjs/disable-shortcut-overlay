# disable-shortcut-overlay
Removes the eye sore of the little blue arrow on shortcuts on Windows.

To use: download the recent release from releases put the download where ever youd like it to be, rum the [Remove Shortcut Overlay](https://github.com/J-dotjs/disable-shortcut-overlay/blob/main/Remove%20Shortcut%20Overlay.bat) file. Boom. Just like that your eyes can rest.
